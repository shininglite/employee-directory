# Employee Directory
Employee Directory is web application, built with React, that displays employee photos, names, phone numbers and dates of birth.

## Purpose
The purpose of the Employee Directory Application is to demonstrate:

- how to build an application with React.js
- how to break up the application's user interface into components
- how to manage component state, (using a class to extend Component)
- how to respond to user events

## User Story
As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once, so that I have quick access to employee information.

## Business Context
An employee, manager, or business owner would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful for a user to be able to filter employees by name.

Given applicable employee data, when a user loads the web page, a table of employees renders to the screen.

The user is able to:
  - sort the table by at least one category
  - filter the users by at least one category

git remote add origin git@github.com:Yuribenjamin/my-app.git

5- Now deploy it to GitHub Pages.

just run the following command :

npm run deploy

'successful build' will be displayed

this command will create a branch named gh-pages this branch host your app, and homepage property you created in package.json file hold your link for a live preview, or you can open the branch setting scroll down to GitHub Pages section you will find this:
