# Employee Directory

Employee Directory is web application, built with React, that displays employee photos, names, phone numbers and dates of birth.

## User Story

As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once, so that I have quick access to employee information.

## Business Context

An employee, manager, or business owner would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful for a user to be able to filter employees by name.

Given applicable employee data, when a user loads the web page, a table of employees should render to the screen.

The user is able to:
  - sort the table by at least one category
  - filter the users by at least one category
